# Crickert-score-card
In this project I write a Python program in which we gives timeline of ball and it giver full score card.
I use list,dictionary,error handling(try and except),loops etc...
In this game you have to enter entire time line of ball and give one space between every ball if you give any cherecter other then space between to ball it give
entry.
rules of ball  and run counts :-

    wkt -----for wicket              
    nb  -----for no ball
